# IEWS(Immediate Earthquake Warning System)

## Introduction
System uses realtime earthquake data from IRIS. Still under active development.
The system is aimed to quickly analyze earthquake waveform and provide reliable earthquake warning.

## Usage
1. run pyslink2mseed_SLA.py to collect realtime waveform data from CI_SLA station.


2. run mseedAnalysis.py to plot waveform from last 10 minutes.


Note: The system cannot provide accurate magnitude analysis and warning at this stage

## Plan
The system will first focus on LA, US. Welcome more people to contribute to this repo.
